### Introduction
The Sensitive Plant, or mimosa pudica, is in the legume family, possessing pods accompanied by leaves that fold at night, or when disturbed. Herbalists and botanists were fascinated by these movements, and in order to study the plant, pudica was burned with acid, cut, and struck by microscopist Robert Hooke in 1661 early trials. Others followed in Hooke’s footsteps: the French botanist René-Louiche Desfontaines took the Sensitive Plant on a horse drawn carriage ride in Paris to see how it would react. Humans were, and continue to be, fascinated by this plant’s ability to move. We, too, are fascinated by this plant–the video you see was taken by us. When we found specimens of Mimosa pudica at the US Botanical Garden in Washington, DC, we could resist the urge to watch the subject of our research perform, to watch the movement that has spurred centuries of wonder questioning.

Mimosa pudica’s influence on Europe, strengthened through literary, scientific, and artistic representations, has been both philosophical and scientific. Herbal uses of this plant were rarely recorded in Europe, whereas in the plant’s home region, South America, many other uses have existed. By tracking perceptions of the mimosa throughout European scientific and popular work, this story considers how bioprospecting and economic botany created culturally-specific habits of engagement with the plant world.  Rather than flatten distinct and diverse knowledge systems relating to mimosa, we have emphasized the ways that these knowledge systems remain vibrant/present, and are being influenced by economic contexts even today. Where contemporary scholarship surrounding the Mimosa pudica has emphasized the plant’s ability to demonstrate plant intelligence and memory, a larger historical narrative of the plant explored here highlights how this very vitality gives way to experimentation, personification, and even violence.

While today this plant is commonly known as the Sensitive Plant, or by its Linnaean name Mimosa pudica, naming this plant is not quite so straightforward. Across the globe, there are seemingly endless names used to refer to what we call the Sensitive Plant. Even going back to the 16th century, there is some naming confusion. In 1578, in what we found to be the earliest mention of this plant, Christoval Acosta describes and illustrates two plants which he calls Yerua Biua and Yerua mimosa. Though it is unclear whether or not those species are Mimosa pudica or just related, scholars think that the Yerua mimosa is indeed this mysterious plant. In 1598, on an expedition to Puerto Rico, John Layfield identifies this plant as Yerva viva. Though he uses a slightly different name, he identifies the plant with the one that Acosta had described. In 1633, we see Gerard’s Herball calling this plant Herba mimosa. When the Royal Society conducted experiments on this plant in 1661, they called it the Sensitive Plant. It wasn’t until 1756, when Carl Linnaeus published Species PLantarum that the binomial name, Mimosa pudica was first used. Beyond names used by European herbalists and botanists, this plant has many other names: bashful plant, chaste plant, touch me not plant, humble plant, and more. Indigenous communities in regions where the Sensitive Plant is native to have their own multitude of names. In Latin America today, dormidera, which means sleeper, is one of many names for this plant.

### Figuring Femininity
19th century European depictions of womanhood were entangled with the plant matter that traveling botanists were extracting from the colonies. Depictions of gender could be reinforced by projecting social conventions onto newly-introduced plants, without overt political invocations. The mimosa, having had both scientific figures and artists figure it as responsive and sensitive, was thus used to normalize ideas about femininity. Maria Edgar’s 1808 watercolor of a woman among foxgloves, roses, and mimosa has been called “a symbol of modern womanhood” for its depiction of “the nurturing power of the female touch." [^1] As Edgar’s figure reaches out to touch the mimosa, viewers can see the sensitivity of both the woman and the potted mimosa plant; critically, one also notices their docility. A few decades prior, a late 18th century stipple engraving entitled “Sensibility” shows Emma Hamilton reaching towards a potted mimosa plant, even as it closes its leaves. Both images play on a femininity that balances separation and adjacency to the natural world.

Visual representations of beauty, sensitivity, and class that use mimosa plants show us how the mimosa’s cultural associations in Europe were entangled, from the start, with its scientific perceptions. Far from being separate realms, science influenced the European public’s ideas of what the mimosa was. In French fashion magazine _Petit Courrier des Dames’_  May 1829 issue, mimosa leaves and branches were advertised as a potential accessory for muslin and tulle dresses. As mimosa grew poorly in European outdoor climes, these fragments of mimosa would have been a challenging acquisition for most women. The association between European women and mimosa plants remained within the contexts of empire--particularly because of its class associations, rarity, and scientific notoriety.

### Encoding and Embodying Empire
By the mid 19th century, the Wardian case was in regular usage by institutions like Kew, allowing them to more easily transport botanical samples (Wardian case article). With this technology, flowering plants like the mimosa could be made useful to colonial science in Europe; they were also being added to a growing repertoire of flowers-as-messages, or cultural icons. _Les Fleurs Animées_, an 1847 French book of botanical stories, offers an example of how class, race, and gender were encoded into European relationships with the mimosa pudica. Illustrations of mimosa within the book were meant to be both instructive and fanciful-- the “sensitive plant” is personified and shown shrinking away from “unwomanly” triggers: tobacco smoke, and garden creatures. The plant’s responsive movements are embodied in the woman’s flight. A particular set of European cultural values that aligned with capitalist visions of white womanhood were not only projected onto plant life, but imagined to be a part of its material embodiment and sensibility.

With Nehemiah Cleaveland’s 1849 translation of _Les Fleurs Animées_ into English, wider audiences could access J.J. Grandville’s illustrations and stories of flowers come to life. [^2] Flowers within, such as the Sunflower or Tulip, were made to embody not only projections of human traits and desires, but also exotification. The collected imagery of mimosa within _Les Fleurs Animées_ was used to argue that the “beauties of the empire” were fond of being compared with the sensitive plant. Considering that the mimosa had been unknown to Europe only 3 centuries prior, the development of its cultural perception as a marker of femininity and high class must be considered critically. The mimosa’s ability to respond to stimuli may have been figured as a disruption to European perceptions of plant life, but was used to solidify hierarchies of race, class, and gender.

### Mimosa as Medicine

These historical contexts, particularly their entanglements with class, race, and gender, have drastically influenced European cultural relationships with mimosa today. Mimosa pudica is contemporarily available as either a houseplant or supplement in Europe, but it has also taken on particular cultural connotations. Consider that its Swedish name (Kruidje roer me niet) has come to colloquially refer to an overly sensitive or touchy person. A diversity of relationships with mimosa pudica exist today, shaped by legacies of capitalism, experimentation, and colonialism. From mimosa’s commercialization as a supplement, to its continued usage in Ayurveda, as well as current propositions to consider the mimosa plant as a mechanism to expand health care in Brazil and Mesoamerica (Ahmad).

Although mimosa is a plant that never took on a mainstream medicinal context in Europe, its presence (made possible through colonial botany) served to advance debates about what it meant to be alive. That this debate was occurring in conjunction with ongoing developments to racial and gendered hierarchies in colonial contexts is not coincidence, but an indication of the ways that popular culture and scientific fact have influenced one another. The WHO’s present-day guideline for “developing countries” to use their natural resources in order to meet health care needs offers a discordant reflection of Linneaus’ own hope that Sweden’s economy might stabilize with further knowledge of Swedish natural resources. [^3] This framing fails to adequately grapple with the histories of exploitation and expropriation of resources from South America by imperialist countries that directly led to Brazil being considered a “developing country” by international standards.

### A Diversity of Knowledge Systems
Integrating herbalism into medical and scientific knowledge systems means tending to the origins of plant-people relationships. In academic contexts, the oral histories and relationships necessary to produce and perpetuate herbal knowledge within communities have historically been devalued. Critical interventions by scholars in Black studies, American history, women’s studies, and Indigenous studies have brought new iterations of these relations explicitly into the academy, while illuminating their ongoing presence. Still, lab-based studies and historical compendiums produced by European colonizers remain sources more commonly cited to gain “legitimacy” on plants. Herbalists today cite a range of sources on plants like the mimosa pudica, considering scientific, historical, social, and culturally-specific accounts of plant usage. The Earth Medicine Institute, for example, cites mimosa pudica’s common names: from China (Han xiu cao) to Borneo (Sulinit). By bringing together a more “global” profile of mimosa, they are seeking a comprehensive overview that classifies mimosa not only by its family (fabaceae) but also by its category (herbs that calm the spirit) and properties (sweet astringent, slightly cold). (Citation forthcoming)

Across herbalist traditions, various parts of the mimosa pudica are used, including its leaves, seeds, flowers, and roots (Ahmad). Although its original habitat was in South America, mimosa has become “naturalized” throughout tropical and subtropical India (Ahmad), leading to its now-traditional usage in Ayurveda under the name lajjalu. With the rise of online herbalist communities, mimosa pudica is lauded on the Internet for its Ayurvedic uses, which range from cosmetic, digestive, endocrine, and neurological to psychospiritual. However, appropriation within online herbalist communities means that treatment information is sometimes shared without cultural context. While non-commercialized community herbalist approaches generally emphasize cultivating relationships with plants in order to understand their properties, this tradition has been disrupted by the mechanization and medicalization of plants. Long (and ongoing) traditions of European bioprospecting and the reduction of plants into compounds have left many people with the impression that plants could work as if they were “naturally-occurring” pills (Whitt, Laurelyn. Science, Colonialism, and Indigenous Peoples : The Cultural Politics of Law and Knowledge, Cambridge University Press, 2009.)

### Ongoing Tensions
Questions of knowledge legitimacy and cultural context are therefore critical to any investigation of the mimosa pudica. The tensions between these factors have animated contemporary art, literature, and herbalism--yet they have not yet significantly impacted the scientific discourse about mimosa pudica. As a plant who has so deeply impacted ideas about what it means to be alive and intelligent, the mimosa offers an opportunity for critical reflection on the ways that socio-cultural concepts influence the scientific construction of fact.
