### (Re)discovering the Sensitive Plant
The Sensitive Plant, or Mimosa pudica, is in the legume family, possessing pods accompanied by leaves that fold at night, or when disturbed.[^1] Herbalists and botanists alike were fascinated by these movements, but the variations in their approaches were ultimately influenced by culturally-mediated beliefs about the meaning of sensitivity, responsiveness, and living. In order to study the plant, it was burned with acid, cut, and struck by microscopist Robert Hooke in 1661 early European scientific trials, intended to elucidate the motivation and mechanism behind the mimosa’s responses.[^2] As European cultural imaginations the Sensitive Plant developed, others  followed in Hooke’s footsteps: in the late 18th century, the French botanist René-Louiche Desfontaines took the Sensitive Plant on a horse drawn carriage ride in Paris to see how it would react.[^3] Inspiration and curiosity stemming from the plant’s movement to (and then, in) Europe led to an ongoing fascination with its ability to move. The mimosa became both a cultural symbol and an object— no longer “simply” a plant. Today, a Mimosa pudica resides at the US Botanical Garden, indicating the continued interest of scientific and botanical authorities in cultivating this unique “weed.”[^4] Consider the adjoining video, taken by the authors at the Botanical Garden, as a reminder that even as we respond to this plant’s legacy, it responds to us too.

The Sensitive Plant, despite its influence in European botany, is native to tropical South America. It was introduced outside of its native range as an ornamental species, and it now grows in many countries in South America, Asia, and the Pacific. The Sensitive Plant is generally a low growing perennial plant, growing to between 15 and 100 centimeters tall.[^5] The leaves are alternate and bipinnate. The pinnae (primary divisions of the leaf) are subdigitate, meaning finger-like. Like many others in the legume family, the Sensitive Plant is nitrogen fixing. The scientific name, Mimosa pudica was coined by Carl Linnaeus. Mimosa comes from a Greek word, ‘mimikos,’ meaning to mimic, and pudica comes from a Latin word that means modest or bashful.[^6] Because this plant forms dense ground cover, it can prevent the reproduction of other species, leading to this plant to be known as a weed. The Sensitive Plant has many traditional medicinal uses across the world, including as a diuretic, antidepressant, aphrodisiac, and a sleep inducer.

While today this plant is commonly known as the Sensitive Plant, or by its Linnaean name Mimosa pudica, naming this plant is not quite so straightforward. Across the globe, there are seemingly endless names used to refer to what we call the Sensitive Plant. Even going back to the 16th century, there is some naming confusion. In 1578, in what we found to be the earliest mention of this plant, Cristóbal Acosta describes and illustrates two plants which he calls Yerua Biua and Yerua mimosa.[^7] Though it is unclear whether or not those species are Mimosa pudica or just related, scholars think that the Yerua mimosa is indeed this mysterious plant. In 1598, on an expedition to Puerto Rico, John Layfield, the chaplain to the third Earl of Cumberland George Clifford, identifies this plant as Yerva viva. Though he uses a slightly different name, he identifies the plant with the one that Acosta had described.[^8] In 1633, we see Gerard’s Herbal calling this plant Herba mimosa. When the Royal Society conducted experiments on this plant in 1661, they called it the Sensitive Plant. It wasn’t until 1756, when Carl Linnaeus, the father of binomial nomenclature, published Species PLantarum that the binomial name, Mimosa pudica was first used.[^9] Beyond names used by European herbalists and botanists, this plant has many other names: bashful plant, chaste plant, touch me not plant, humble plant, and more. Indigenous communities in regions where the Sensitive Plant is native to have their own multitude of names. Pinahuihuitztli and cocochiatl are two Nahautl names noted by Spanish naturalist and explorer Francisco Hernández in 1570.[^10] In Latin America today, dormidera, which means sleeper, is one of many names for this plant.

Mimosa pudica’s influence on Europe, strengthened through literary, scientific, and artistic representations, has been both philosophical and scientific. Herbal uses of this plant were rarely recorded in Europe, whereas in the plant’s home region, South America, many other uses have existed. By tracking perceptions of the mimosa throughout European scientific and popular work, this story considers how bioprospecting and economic botany created culturally-specific habits of engagement with the plant world.  Rather than flatten distinct and diverse knowledge systems relating to mimosa, we have emphasized the ways that these knowledge systems remain vibrant/present, and are being influenced by economic contexts even today. Where contemporary scholarship surrounding the Mimosa pudica has emphasized the plant’s ability to demonstrate plant intelligence and memory, a larger historical narrative of the plant explored here highlights how this very vitality gives way to experimentation, personification, and even violence.

### Integrating Science and Culture - European Botany and Figures of Femininity

The fascinating movement of the Sensitive Plant has made it a popular study for botanists for centuries. From the scholarship we were able to uncover, it seems that the first experiments done on the Mimosa were performed by the Royal Society in 1661. This study of the plant was performed at the request of King Charles II. Members of the Royal Society focused light on the plant, cut off leaflets, and poured nitric acid on the plant. They found that the intensity of the plant’s reaction was proportional to the strength of each stimulus, and they theorized that a “liquor” constantly circulates in the plant, akin to circulating blood in a human.[^11] Upon stimulation, the liquor moves, and the leaflets close. In 1757, John Hill experimented with the plant, and he claimed that light, rather than heat or moisture causes the leaflets to close and droop. In the late 18th century, Jean-Jaques d’Ortous de Marian, a French natural philosopher, also conducted experiments on the Sensitive Plant. He exposed the plants to constant darkness and concluded that the daily opening and closing of the leaves continued even in darkness.[^12]

19th century European depictions of womanhood were entangled with the plant matter that traveling botanists were extracting from the colonies. Depictions of gender could be reinforced by projecting social conventions onto newly-introduced plants, without overt political invocations. The mimosa, having had both scientific figures and artists figure it as responsive and sensitive, was thus used to normalize ideas about femininity. Maria Edgar’s 1808 watercolor of a woman among foxgloves, roses, and mimosa has been called “a symbol of modern womanhood” for its depiction of “the nurturing power of the female touch." [^13] As Edgar’s figure reaches out to touch the mimosa, viewers can see the sensitivity of both the woman and the potted mimosa plant; critically, one also notices their docility. A few decades prior, a late 18th century stipple engraving entitled “Sensibility” shows Emma Hamilton reaching towards a potted mimosa plant, even as it closes its leaves. Both images play on a femininity that balances separation and adjacency to the natural world.

Visual representations of beauty, sensitivity, and class that use mimosa plants show us how the mimosa’s cultural associations in Europe were entangled, from the start, with its scientific perceptions. Far from being separate realms, science influenced the European public’s ideas of what the mimosa was. In French fashion magazine _Petit Courrier des Dames’_  May 1829 issue, mimosa leaves and branches were advertised as a potential accessory for muslin and tulle dresses. As mimosa grew poorly in European outdoor climes, these fragments of mimosa would have been a challenging acquisition for most women. The association between European women and mimosa plants remained within the contexts of empire--particularly because of its class associations, rarity, and scientific notoriety.

The Mimosa pudica also captured the attention of writers and storytellers in addition to scientists. In 1791 Erasmus Darwin described the Mimosa pudica in his poem The Loves of the Plants, the second of two poems aimed at educating the public in botany and taxonomy. The Loves of the Plants animates Linneanian classification by anthropomorphized flowers. However, considering Linnaean taxonomy relies on sexual difference and reproduction for classification, the poems read as quite scandalous at times. Here the Mimosa pudica fascinates not only for its movement but for its reproduction. The mimosa, carrying both male and female reproductive organs on a single plant does not need a partner to reproduce. The combination of the plant's movement and reproduction leads Darwin to describe the plant as chaste, avoiding “rude touches” and “feels, alive through all her tender form.”Darwin writes further about the Mimosa pudica beyond his poem, describing his own puzzlement and experimentation with the plant. He writes   
"…I have found, when touched in the night during their sleep, they fall still further; especially when touched on the foot-stalks between the stems and the leaflets, which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part. Now as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles their sleep, but with a greater degree of collapse, may it not be owing to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation, like the faintings of animals from pain or fatigue?" It is telling that Darwin describes the external stimuli toward the plant as violence on multiple occasions especially considering Darwin himself makes attempts to replicate this violence in the plants most “sensitive or irritable part.” Darwin, when shown a plant’s capacity to feel, responds by experimenting how far and to what extent. This is further demonstrated when Darwin keeps a Mimosa pudica in a dark room to observe the plant “sleeping.” Darwin concludes that the plant feels, sleeps, and possibly faints like an animal. Although the primary purpose of The Loves of the Plants is poetry making accessible scientific language, Darwin cannot help but relay his own experimentation, highlighting the mesmerism of the Mimosa.

It is precisely the Mimosa pudica’s otherworldly capacity to feel that captures Percy Shelley’s attention. One of her last written works, “The Sensitive Plant” embraces the plant’s all consuming affect. Told in three parts, the poem begins similarly to Darwin’s with the sensitive plant growing “companionless” in the garden. In the second part Shelley introduces the gardener, a similarly solitary woman who dedicates herself to her plants. The gardener, where companionless, is adored by the garden. Shelley writes “I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet/Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;/I doubt not they felt the spirit that came/From her glowing fingers through all their frame.”(140-145). Here Shelley is speculating that the flowers themselves cared for the women that tended to them. In return, she is so devoted to that garden that “If the flowers had been her own infants, she/Could never have nursed them more tenderly”(153-155). In the very last line of this section, the woman abruptly dies leaving the garden to mourn in the third section. Her plants left alone become overgrown and decay with the exception of the sensitive plant who “Wept, and the tears within each lid/Of its folded leaves, which together grew,/Were changed to a blight of frozen glue” (253-255). The plant here is remarkable for its capacity to feel and mourn, reaching far beyond scientists desire for objectivity. Here the plant’s artistic power is precisely in the personification scientists sought to avoid. Theresa Kelley, speaking to Shelley’s departure from Darwin’s sexual classification, writes “Shelley’s Sensitive-plant is an “it,” but it is an it who loves what it has not. In the language of Shelley’s poem, requiring no sexual companion to reproduce is hardly if at all at issue. What matters is rather its capacity for feeling” (Kelley 211-212). The Mimosa pudica here is significant not as a scientific oddity but as something that has an other worldly capacity to feel. This deep sense of affect is all the more moving when considering Shelley wrote this poem at a particularly devastating point in his life where he was chronically ill and mourning the loss of a child.

By the mid 19th century, the Wardian case was in regular usage by institutions like Kew, allowing them to more easily transport botanical samples.[^14] With this technology, flowering plants like the mimosa could be made useful to colonial science in Europe; they were also being added to a growing repertoire of flowers-as-messages, or cultural icons. _Les Fleurs Animées_, an 1847 French book of botanical stories, offers an example of how class, race, and gender were encoded into European relationships with the mimosa pudica. Illustrations of mimosa within the book were meant to be both instructive and fanciful-- the “sensitive plant” is personified and shown shrinking away from “unwomanly” triggers: tobacco smoke, and garden creatures. The plant’s responsive movements are embodied in the woman’s flight. A particular set of European cultural values that aligned with capitalist visions of white womanhood were not only projected onto plant life, but imagined to be a part of its material embodiment and sensibility.

With Nehemiah Cleaveland’s 1849 translation of _Les Fleurs Animées_ into English, wider audiences could access J.J. Grandville’s illustrations and stories of flowers come to life. [^15] Flowers within, such as the Sunflower or Tulip, were made to embody not only projections of human traits and desires, but also exotification. The collected imagery of mimosa within _Les Fleurs Animées_ was used to argue that the “beauties of the empire” were fond of being compared with the sensitive plant. Considering that the mimosa had been unknown to Europe only 3 centuries prior, the development of its cultural perception as a marker of femininity and high class must be considered critically. The mimosa’s ability to respond to stimuli may have been figured as a disruption to European perceptions of plant life, but was used to solidify hierarchies of race, class, and gender.

### Mimosa as Medicine in a Diversity of Knowledge Systems

These historical contexts, particularly their entanglements with class, race, and gender, have drastically influenced European cultural relationships with mimosa today. Mimosa pudica is contemporarily available as either a houseplant or supplement in Europe, but it has also taken on particular cultural connotations.[^16] Consider that its Swedish name (Kruidje roer me niet) has come to colloquially refer to an overly sensitive or touchy person. A diversity of relationships with mimosa pudica exist today, shaped by legacies of capitalism, experimentation, and colonialism. From mimosa’s commercialization as a supplement, to its continued usage in Ayurveda, as well as current propositions to consider the mimosa plant as a mechanism to expand health care in Brazil and Mesoamerica.[^17]

Although mimosa is a plant that never took on a mainstream medicinal context in Europe, its presence (made possible through colonial botany) served to advance debates about what it meant to be alive. That this debate was occurring in conjunction with ongoing developments to racial and gendered hierarchies in colonial contexts is not coincidence, but an indication of the ways that popular culture and scientific fact have influenced one another. The WHO’s present-day guideline for “developing countries” to use their natural resources in order to meet health care needs offers a discordant reflection of Linneaus’ own hope that Sweden’s economy might stabilize with further knowledge of Swedish natural resources. [^18] This framing fails to adequately grapple with the histories of exploitation and expropriation of resources from South America by imperialist countries that directly led to Brazil being considered a “developing country” by international standards. Consider the adjoining map's slider tool, which indicates current vs. native distribution of the mimosa.

Integrating herbalism into medical and scientific knowledge systems means tending to the origins of plant-people relationships.[^19] Critical interventions by scholars in Black studies, American history, women’s studies, and Indigenous studies have brought new iterations of these relations explicitly into the academy, while illuminating their ongoing presence(s). Still, lab-based studies and historical compendiums produced by European colonizers remain sources more commonly cited to gain “legitimacy” on plants. Herbalists today cite a range of sources on plants like the mimosa pudica, considering scientific, historical, social, and culturally-specific accounts of plant usage. The Earth Medicine Institute, for example, cites mimosa pudica’s common names: from China (Han xiu cao) to Borneo (Sulinit). By bringing together a more “global” profile of mimosa, they are seeking a comprehensive overview that classifies mimosa not only by its family (fabaceae) but also by its category (herbs that calm the spirit) and properties (sweet astringent, slightly cold).[^20]

Across herbalist traditions, various parts of the mimosa pudica are used, including its leaves, seeds, flowers, and roots.[^21] Although its original habitat was in South America, mimosa has become “naturalized” throughout tropical and subtropical India, leading to its now-traditional usage in Ayurveda under the name lajjalu.[^22] With the rise of online herbalist communities, mimosa pudica is lauded on the Internet for its Ayurvedic uses, which range from cosmetic, digestive, endocrine, and neurological to psychospiritual. However, appropriation within online herbalist communities means that treatment information is sometimes shared without cultural context. While non-commercialized community herbalist approaches generally emphasize cultivating relationships with plants in order to understand their properties, this tradition has been disrupted by the mechanization and medicalization of plants. Long (and ongoing) traditions of European bioprospecting and the reduction of plants into compounds have left many people with the impression that plants could work as if they were “naturally-occurring” pills.[^23]

### Makahiya and Memory
Poet Crystal Z Campell draws on the many-layered histories of the Mimosa pudica in their poem “Makahiya (How Do I Tell You I Remember)”. In the title, “Makahiya” refers to the Filipino name for the Mimosa. By placing this name in the title alongside “How Do I Tell You I Remember,” Campbell situates her poem in Filipino storytelling where the Makahiya is a shy young girl transformed into a plant to protect her from invaders. Building from this, the opening stanza reads, “Can a weed be humble/ bashful, sensitive, or shy/ to test for memory, drop it from its senses/ lean over the balcony/ with your camera/ telephoto a royal freefall/ repeat from increasing crowns, observe/ in bursts, freeze/ a mandrake’s scream/ in frames/ (to survive, means you have mastered the art of feigning sleep.)”. Here Campbell refuses the plant’s Latin name, referring to the plant only as a weed. The Mimosa is frequently identified as an invasive species in tropical climates including the Philippines. However, the use of weed here highlights the evasive aspects of the plant and its many names. They ask if a plant can be humble, bashful, sensitive, or shy, referring to the many different common names evoked to describe or explain the plant’s unique behavior. Additionally, Campbell alludes to the scientific studies done with the plant to test for memory that involved dropping the plant at various time intervals. In this short stanza, the poet encompasses a vast history of a singular plant modestly referred to as a weed. Perhaps this is what Campbell is referring to when they describe survival meaning mastering the art of feigning sleep.

### Ongoing Tensions
The movement of the Sensitive Plant posed a problem for early European botanists – how could a plant have such sensitivity? For centuries, Hellenistic philosophy reigned supreme. Aristotle and Theophrastus both argue that plants are characterized by an “insensitive Vegetative soul,” and animals are characterized by a “Sensitive Soul.” Animals were capable of making active responses to external stimuli, but plants were supposed to be passive—their only faculties devoted to nutrient intake and reproduction. This philosophy, which clearly differentiated between plants and animals based on their sensitivity, had authority well into the 17th century.

When John Layfield first encountered the Sensitive Plant in Puerto Rico in the late 16th century, he directly acknowledged how this plant challenges Hellenistic philosophy: “It hath a property, which confoundeth my understanding, and perhaps will seem strange in the way of the Philosophers, who have denied every part of sense to my plant; yet this certainly seemeth to have feeling.” Many botanists attempted to come up with mechanical explanations for the movement of this plant, especially under the influence of Rene Descartes, a prominent philospher and scientist, who popularized the idea that all nature and organisms are machines. Descartes’ ideas of mechanism made it possible to explain plant movement “in terms of physical causes reducible to matter and movement,” avoiding the idea that plants could have feelings. The Royal Society, in 1661, conducted experiments on the Sensitive Plant, theorizing that the circulation of some kind of sap allowed the plant to move. A century later, botanists were still grappling with whether or not the Sensitive Plant could feel. Abbe de Vallemont, a French scientist, declared that the “Sensitive Plant has no more sense than a cabbage,” demonstrating the maintained prevalence of Hellenistic philosophy and mechanicism. Even later, in the early 19th century, Agnes Ibbetson, an English botanist, disagreed with those who thought that the Mimosa had inherent feeling or sensitivity. Instead, she wrote that plants are “machines governed wholly by light and moisture; and dependent on these causes for motion.”

Questions of knowledge legitimacy and cultural context are therefore critical to any investigation of the mimosa pudica. The tensions between these factors have animated contemporary art, literature, and herbalism--yet they have not yet significantly impacted the scientific discourse about mimosa pudica. As a plant who has so deeply impacted ideas about what it means to be alive and intelligent, the mimosa offers an opportunity for critical reflection on the ways that socio-cultural concepts influence the scientific construction of nature.[^24]
